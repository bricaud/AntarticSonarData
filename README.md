# AntarticSonarData
Jupyter notebooks for the analysis of sonar data. Made during the [Data Jam Days](http://datajamdays.org) at EPFL on 24-25 Nov. 2017.
This work was done together with [Camille Le Guen](http://camleguen.wixsite.com/monsite).

More details about the study on my blog post [Exploring the oceans, around Antartica](https://bricaud.github.io/personal-blog/antartic-data-exploration/).

* The first notebook details the processing steps.
* The second notebook contains the processing steps as functions that are called for each file to be processed. It shows how to process several files of data.
